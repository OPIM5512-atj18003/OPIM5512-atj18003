## 👋 Hi, I'm Alex Jones
📍 _MS in Data Science, University of Connecticut_

## 🔬 About Me
I graduated with a degree in cell biology from UConn, with no idea what I wanted to do. While on the job search, curiosity led me to data analytics and computer science tutorials and free courses. One year later, I applied to UConn's Data Science Master's Program, and since then have stepped out of my comfort zone, taking advantage of every opportunity and event to learn as much as I can 

## 🧰 Currently Learning  
- Python-based data science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- Data mining techniques (classification, clustering, association analysis, anomaly detection)  
- Analytics-based marketing management (market research, segmentation, performance evaluation)
